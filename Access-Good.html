<p>The Web is fundamentally designed to work for all people, whatever their hardware, software, language, culture, location, or physical or mental ability. When the Web meets this goal, it is accessible to people with a diverse range of hearing, movement, sight, and cognitive ability.</p></br></br>
<p>Thus the impact of disability is radically changed on the Web because the Web removes barriers to communication and interaction that many people face in the physical world. However, when websites, web technologies, or web tools are badly designed, they can create barriers that exclude people from using the Web.</br></br><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/">Understanding WCAG 2.0: A guide to understanding and implementing Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0</a></p>

<h2>Why: The Case for Web Accessibility</h2></br>
</br>

<p>It is essential that the Web be accessible in order to provide equal access and equal opportunity to people with diverse abilities. Indeed, the <a href = "http://www.un.org/disabilities/default.asp?navid=12&pid=150">UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities</a> recognizes access to information and communications technologies, including the Web, as a basic human right.</p></br></br>
<p>Accessibility supports social inclusion for people with disabilities as well as <a href = "http://www.w3.org/WAI/bcase/soc.html#groups">others</a>, such as <a href = "http://www.w3.org/WAI/bcase/soc.html#older">older people, people in rural areas, and people in developing countries.</p>

<h2>What: Examples of Web Accessibility</h2><br><br>
<p>Properly designed websites and web tools can be <a href = "http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/people-use-web.php">used by people with disabilities</a>. However, currently many sites and tools are developed with accessibility barriers that make it difficult or impossible for some people to use them. Below are just a few examples.</p><br><br>
<h3>Alternative Text for Images<h3><br>
<img src="http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/alt-logo.png"></img><br><br>

<p>Alt text is the classic example. Images should include <a href = "http://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/text-equiv.html">equivalent alternative text</a> in the markup/code.<br>
If alt text isn't provided for images, the image information is inaccessible, for example, to people who cannot see and use a screen reader that reads aloud the information on a page, including the alt text for the visual image.</p>

<h2>Keyboard Input</h2><br><br>

<img src="http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/no-mouse.png"></img><br><br>
<p>Some people cannot use a mouse, including many older users with limited fine motor control. An accessible website does not rely on the mouse; it provides <a href = "http://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/keyboard-operation.html">all functionality via a keyboard</a>. Then people with disabilities can use <a href ="http://www.w3.org/WAI/users/involving#at">assistive technologies</a> that mimic the keyboard, such as speech input.</p><br><br>

<h2>Transcripts for Podcasts</h2><br><br>

<img src="http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/transcript.png"></img><br><br>
<p>Just as images aren't available to people who can't see, audio files aren't available to people who can't hear. Providing a text transcript makes the audio information accessible to people who are deaf or hard of hearing, as well as to search engines and other technologies that can't hear.<br><br><a href = "http://www.uiaccess.com/transcripts/transcript_services.html">Transcription Services</a></p><br><br>

<h2>How: Make Your Website and Web Tools Accessible</h2><br><br>


<p>
Most of the basics of accessibility are even easier and less expensive than providing transcripts. However, the proper techniques are poorly integrated into some web tools, education, and development processes. If you are new to accessibility, it takes some time and effort to learn the common issues and solutions. A starting place is the <a href = "http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/accessibility.php">Introduction to Web Accessibility</a>.
</br></br>

Using authoring tools that support accessibility makes it easier for website developers. Browsers also play a role in accessibility. Essential Components of Web Accessibility explains the relationships between the different components of web development and interaction.</br></br>
Accessibility is essential for developers and organizations that want to create high quality websites and web tools, and not exclude people from using their products and services.</p></br></br>

<h2>Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) at W3C</h2><br><br>


<p>
The W3C <a href = "http://www.w3.org/WAI/">Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI)</a> brings together people from industry, disability organizations, government, and research labs from around the world to develop guidelines and resources to help make the Web accessible to people with disabilities including auditory, cognitive, neurological, physical, speech, and visual disabilities.
</br></br>
WAI's coverage of web accessibility includes <a href = "http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/wcag.php">'web content'</a> (websites and web applications), <a href = "http://www.w3.org/WAI/impl/software">authoring tools</a> (such as content management systems (CMS) and blog software), browsers and other <a href ="http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/uaag.php">'user agents'</a>, and <a href = "http://www.w3.org/WAI/PF/">W3C technical specifications</a>, including WAI-ARIA for accessible rich Internet applications.</br></br>
We invite individuals and organizations to <a href = "http://www.w3.org/WAI/participation">participate in WAI</a> by volunteering to implement, promote, and review guidelines; contributing to the <a href = "http://www.w3.org/WAI/IG/">WAI Interest Group</a>; and participating in Working Groups.</p></br></br>
